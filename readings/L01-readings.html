                <h3>Notes from the readings - Anyway Kambeva</h3>  

                <p><b>Course outcomes: </b>Develop and improve my skills to create web applications using HTML, 
                    CSS, and JavaScript. Help and learn from others (team work and collaboration). Ability to 
                    develop programs, finding and troubleshooting problems.
                </p>
                
                <p><b>Software: </b>Complete all the necessary software setup and SitePoint subscription. I've completed 
                    all setup, just waiting for SitePoint access code.
                </p>

                <p><b>Teamwork: </b>To achieve success as a team, each member must contribute meaningfully by proper 
                    planning and preparing for meetings, completing assigned tasks and necessary research. 
                    Through teamwork, we draw from the strength of each other.
                </p>

                <p>The ability to work with others is crucial for both “current and future team members”. Not always 
                    easy to coordinate schedules and keep everyone on the same page. Communication is key to success 
                    in group work.
                </p>

                <p>I must take responsibility for my own education and learning, participate and contribute actively, 
                    and prompt to scheduled weekly meetings.
                </p>

                <p><b>Questions about the Material:</b><br>No questions at the moment, just still waiting to get access 
                    code for SitePoint to complete the Git It Together course, and still trying to get connected with my 
                    group on Trello. I created a Trello account and asked to be invited or added to the group and or board, 
                    but no one has responded to me yet despite requests to be added.
