                <h3>Testing and Debugging - Chapter 10:</h3>  

                <p>Both programmer and user errors are considered to be a programmer's responsibility, as well as to
                     predict possible errors that may rise so as to fix and minimize such errors promptly.<br><br>
                    <b>Warnings: </b>A program may continue to run with errors but can be problematic because the issue 
                    may cause the program to continue running incorrectly.<br>
                    It's better to spot errors early than have them cause problems later.<br><br>

                    <b>Strict mode</b> use is recommended as it encourages writing better quality JavaScript which is 
                    beneficial to programmers. To use strict mode, the following string is required at the first line 
                    of a JavaScript file: 'use strict';<br>

                    Strict mode can also be used per-function basis by adding the “use strict” string inside a function which 
                    will then only be applied to anything inside that function. This is the recommended way.<br>

                    The alert() method is a basic form of debugging used to show a dialog at certain points in the code. 
                    The alert() stops a program from running until OK is clicked, it allows to put breakpoints in the code 
                    allowing to check the value of variables at that point to see if they're as expected. The use of 
                    the alert() method for debugging is now discouraged.<br><br>

                    <b>The Console: </b>as a debugging method is well supported in all the major browsers.<br><br>

                    <b>Debugging Tools: </b>Most modern browsers have a debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints 
                    in your code that will pause it at certain points.<br><br>
                    <b>Testing: </b>An important part of programming. “Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle 
                    as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on” and fixed.
