                <h3>Get Started with JSON Web Tokens:</h3>  

                <p><b>JSON Web Token: </b>is a <b>compact</b>, URL-safe means for securely transmitting information between parties 
                    as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.<br><br>
                    <b>Compact:</b>it can be sent through an URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header, and because of its 
                    size transmission is fast.<br><br>

                    <b>When to use JSON WEB TOKENS: </b><br>
                    ▪	<b>Authentication: </b>Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, 
                    allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign 
                    On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays.<br><br>
                    ▪	<b>Information Exchange: </b>JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties, 
                    because as they can be signed, for example using a public/private key pair, you can be sure that the 
                    sender is who they say they are.<br><br>

                    <b>JSON WEB TOKEN STRUCTURE: </b>consist of three parts separated by dots, e.g. xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz<br><br>
                    
                        ▪	<b>Header:</b> typically consists of two parts: type of token (which is JWT) and the hashing algorithm.<br><br>
                        ▪	<b>Payload:</b> contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and 
                        additional metadata. There are three types of claims:<br><br>
                        1.	Reserved: set of predefined claims, not mandatory but recommended, provides a set of useful, interoperable claims. 
                        Some of them are: iss (issuer), exp (expiration time), sub (subject), aud (audience), among others.<br><br>
                        2.	Public: can be defined at will by those using JWTs. But to avoid collisions they should be defined in 
                        the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or be defined as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.<br><br>
                        3.	Private: custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them.<br><br>
                        ▪	<b>Signature:</b> To create the signature part, you take the encoded header, encoded payload, a secret, 
                        the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that. The signature is used to verify the sender of the 
                        JSON and to ensure that the message wasn't altered in the way.<br><br>

                    <b>Benefits of JSON Web Tokens: </b>JSON is less verbose than XML, smaller size when encoded. JWT is a good 
                    choice to be passed in HTML and HTTP environments.<br><br>
                    JSON parsers are common in most programming languages, because they map directly to objects and this makes it 
                    easier to work.<br><br>
                    Regarding usage, JWT is used at an Internet scale. This highlights the ease of client side processing of JWTs 
                    on multiple platforms, especially, mobile.<br><br>
