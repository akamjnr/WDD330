                <h3>Introduction to Functions, Execution Context and the Call Stack</h3>  

                <p>When JavaScript code runs, it parses line by line interpreting words that has meaning in the JavaScript 
                    engine, and use them as instructions to tell a computer what to do. When this happens, it is actually 
                    storing stuff (e.g. functions, variables) in memory. This process of taking and running code line by line 
                    is known as a thread of execution.<br><br>                    

                    <b>Global execution context: </b>The stuff (e.g. functions and variables) we declare or store in memory at 
                    the beginning of our code will be available anywhere inside of our application.<br><br>

                    <b>JavaScript thread: </b> means that we go through our code line by line, from top to bottom, without 
                    skipping any line. This means that it is synchronous and single threaded, one thing at a time.<br><br>

                    <b>Functions: </b>a way of wrapping up some instruction (code) to be done at a later stage, we can refer to 
                    this code later for execution. JavaScript never leaves a label without a value, and the default value is 
                    undefined. Anything we declare inside a function is committed to a little memory just for that function, 
                    not global memory. This is called function level or local.<br><br>

                    <b>Call Stack: </b>When we call a function, we create an execution context and stack is a perfect way for 
                    tracking our execution context.<br><br>

                    <h3>Understanding Callbacks & Higher Order Functions</h3>

                    This video is very practical and almost difficult to write notes. I did watch the entire video and followed 
                    through the explanation. It is a continuation of the examples and principles laid out in the first video.<br><br>
