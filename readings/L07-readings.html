                <h3>Further Functions - Chapter 11:</h3>  

                <p><b>Functions: </b>First-class objects, they can be passed around in the same way as every other value. 
                    They can have their own properties and methods, as well as accepting other functions as parameters and 
                    being returned by other functions.<br><br>
                    “All functions have a length property that returns the number of parameters the function has… The call() 
                    method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided as the first 
                    argument.”<br><br>
                    If a function doesn't refer to an object as this in its body, it can still be called using the call() 
                    method, but null must be provided as its first argument.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Custom Properties: </b>Properties to functions can be customized in the same way as adding properties 
                    to any JavaScript object.<br><br>

                    <b>Memoization: </b>Provides result caching, or memoization. If a function takes some time to compute a 
                    return value, we can save the result in a cache property. If the same argument is used again later, we 
                    can simply return the value from the cache, than having to compute the result again.<br><br>

                    <b>IIFE: </b>(Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is an anonymous function that is invoked as soon as 
                    it is defined. This is accomplished by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition 
                    (parentheses are used to invoke a function). The function must also be made into an expression by placing 
                    the whole declaration inside parentheses.<br><br>
                    IIFEs are useful for performing a task while keeping any variables wrapped up within the function, meaning 
                    the global namespace will not be polluted with lots of variable names.<br><br>

                    <b>Temporary Variables: </b>Once a variable has been declared, it can't be removed from a scope. If the 
                    variable is only required temporarily, it may create confusion, errors or even clash with another piece of 
                    code, if it's still available later in the code. Code that uses the temporary variable must be placed 
                    inside an IIFE so that it's only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear.<br><br>

                    <b>Safe Use of Strict Mode: </b>Placing 'use strict' at the beginning of a file can be problematic in that, 
                    it will enforce strict mode on all the JavaScript in the file. It is therefore recommended to place all your 
                    code inside an IIFE, and only the code inside the IIFE is forced to use strict mode.<br><br>
                    “An IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it doesn't interfere with 
                    any other part of the program. Using IIFEs in this way means code can be added or removed separately.”<br><br>

                    <b>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves: </b>The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function 
                    can both call and define itself, and even redefine itself by assigning an anonymous function to a variable 
                    that has the same name as the function.<br><br>

                    <b>Recursive Function: </b>is a function that invokes itself until a certain condition is met.<br><br>

                    <b>Callback Hell: </b>refers to a tangled mess of code. More and more callbacks are being 
                    used as the use of asynchronous programming in JavaScript increases.<br><br>

                    <b>Async Functions: </b>are preceded by the async keyword and allow you to write asynchronous code as if 
                    it was synchronous. This is achieved by using the await operator before an asynchronous function. This will 
                    wrap the return value of the function in a promise that can then be assigned to a variable. The next line 
                    of code is not executed until the promise is resolved.<br><br>

                    <b>Closures: </b>one of JavaScript's most powerful features, but can be difficult to understand initially. 
                    A closure is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function, maintaining access to any 
                    variables declared inside the enclosing function. A closure is a reference to a variable that was created 
                    inside the scope of another function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of the program.<br><br>

                    “Closures not only have access to variables declared in a parent function's scope, they can also change the 
                    value of these variables.”<br><br>
