                <h3>Object-Oriented Programming: Chapter 12</h3>  

                <p><b>3 main concepts in OOP:</b><br><br>
                    1.	Encapsulation: the inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the 
                    essential functionalities are exposed to the end user. This involves keeping all the 
                    programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, 
                    without the outside world needing to know how it's done.<br><br>

                    2.	Polymorphism: the same process can be used for different objects. In OOP, this means various 
                    objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a 
                    more specific implementation.<br><br>

                    3.	Inheritance: taking the features of one object then adding some new features. We can take an 
                    object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its 
                    functionality by adding new properties and methods                    
                </p>
                
                <p><b>Classes: </b>Class-based languages use a class to define a blueprint for an object - Java, Ruby.
                </p>

                <p><b>Constructor Functions: </b>“JavaScript contains a number of built-in constructor functions such 
                    as Object, Array, and Function that can be used to create objects, arrays and functions instead of 
                    literals.” Names of constructor functions or class declarations are capitalized, which is the 
                    convention used for classes in class-based programming languages.                    
                </p>
