                <h3>Forms - Chapter 8:</h3>  

                <p><b>Forms: </b>Made up of form element which contains form controls such as select menus, 
                    buttons and input fields which can be populated with information that is then processed 
                    once the form is submitted.<br><br>
                    Form controls have an initial value specified in the HTML code that can be changed when a user 
                    enters information or interact with the form's interface. That value can also be changed dynamically 
                    using JavaScript.<br>
                    Form objects have some useful properties and methods used to interact with the form.<br><br>
                    
                    The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically, and using this method won't trigger 
                    the form submit event.<br><br>

                    The form.reset() method resets all the form controls back to their initial HTML specified values. 
                    A button with a type attribute of reset can also resets all controls without additional scripting. 
                    “Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to click and then 
                    wipe out all the data that's been entered.”<br><br>

                    The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it's sent to a different 
                    URL to be processed on the server.<br><br>

                    <b>Form Events: </b>Focus event occurs when an element is focused on, e.g. an input element, this is 
                    when the cursor is placed inside the element (by either clicking or tapping on it or navigating to it 
                    using the keyboard).<br>
                    The blur event occurs when user moves the focus away from the form element.<br>
                    The change event occurs when a user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it. If a 
                    user clicks in an input field and makes no changes, then clicks elsewhere, the change event won't fire, 
                    but the blur event will.<br><br>

                    <b>Submitting a Form: </b>Submit is possibly the most important form event that occurs when the form is 
                    submitted and this will send the content of the form to the server for processing. The form can be 
                    intercepted before it's sent using JavaScript by adding a submit event listener. The form can also be 
                    stopped from being submitted by using the preventDefault() method.<br><br>

                    <b>Form Controls: </b>Common form control types:<br> 
                    ▪	input fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads.<br>
                    ▪	select menus for drop-down lists of options.<br>
                    ▪	textarea elements for longer text entry.<br>
                    ▪	button elements for submitting and resetting forms.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Form Validation: </b>Process of checking whether a user has entered the information into a form correctly. 
                    Validation can occur, and is advisable to use it, on both the client and server side using JavaScript.<br><br>
