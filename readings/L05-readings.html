                <h3>Ajax - Chapter 13:</h3>  

                <p><b>Ajax: </b>“Technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and 
                    it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. This enables data to be sent and received 
                    in the background, as well as portions of a page to be updated in response to user events, 
                    while the rest of the program continues to run”.<br>
                    Ajax is revolutionary and has enabled websites to be dynamic rather than static.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Clients and Servers: </b>the internet (web of computers) has two parts, namely, clients 
                    (e.g. Web browser) and servers. A client makes a request for a resource from server, server 
                    processes the request and responds back to client.<br> 
                    Ajax technique allows JavaScript to request resources (usually: JSON data, text or html) on 
                    behalf of the client from the server. Most commonly used data type in Ajax nowadays is JSON, 
                    because it's lightweight, easier to parse than XML, and is natively supported in JavaScript.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>API </b>(Application Programming Interface) - methods that allows external access to another program or service.<br><br>

                    <b>Fetch API: </b>Standard for requesting and sending data asynchronously across a network.<br><br>

                    <b>JSON </b>is the most common format for AJAX responses. The json() method is used to transform a stream of JSON data into 
                    a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.<br><br>

                    <b>Request Interface: </b>More control is gained over the request being made by providing a Request object as an argument. 
                    Request objects are created using the Request() constructor.<br><br>

                    <b>HTTP: </b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol - “When a client (usually a browser) makes a request to a 
                    server, it contains information about which HTTP verb to use”. HTTP verbs (HTTP methods) tell the 
                    server what type of request is being made.<br>
                    5 most commonly used verbs when dealing with resources on the web: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE. 
                    A link in a web page will make a GET request by default and forms are also submitted using a GET 
                    request by default, but will often use a POST request.<br><br>

                    <b>Sending Information: </b>Ajax can also be used to send information in variety of formats, but usually 
                    a JSON string.<br>
                    Most forms will have an action attribute that specifies the URL to use if the form is sent without using 
                    Ajax and will also have a method attribute that will specify the HTTP verb to use.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>FormData: </b>Fetch API includes the FormData interface, which makes it much easier to submit information 
                    in forms using Ajax. FormData interface helps to reduce the amount of code needed when submitting forms.
