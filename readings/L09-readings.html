                <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>  

                <p>HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language.<br><br>

                    <b>HTML5: </b>W3C plans to develop versions of HTML5 frequently using smaller version increments, e.g. 
                    (HTML 5.1 is the latest standard, HTML 5.2 is in development). Very useful site to check for specific 
                    features is <a href="https://caniuse.com/" target="_blank">Can I Use.</a><br><br>

                    <b>The data- Attribute:</b> way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored 
                    by the browser - their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program to access information about a 
                    particular element on the page.<br><br>

                    These attributes name can be decided by the developer, but they must use the following format:<br><br>
                    Start with data-<br>
                    Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.<br>
                    Include an optional string value.<br>

                    The information in the attributes can be used to identify elements and values of the attributes can also 
                    be used to filter different elements.<br><br>

                    Data attributes provide a convenient way of adding data directly into the HTML markup, enabling a richer 
                    user experience.<br><br>

                    <b>HTML5 APIs: </b>HTML5 specification contains APIs that helps gain access to hardware, (e.g. cameras, 
                    batteries, geolocation, graphics card). As hardware evolves, APIs are introduced regularly to enable 
                    developers access and control to new features in latest devices.<br><br>

                    <b>HTML5 Web Storage API: </b>Stores information about users on the client's computer (works almost similar 
                    to using cookies), as well as application-specific information that can then be used during future sessions.<br><br>

                    Difference between Web Storage API and cookies:<br><br>
                    ▪	Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.<br>
                    ▪	Information is available in multiple windows of the browser, only if the domain is the same.<br>
                    ▪	Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies (no actual limit in the 
                    specification, but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.).<br>
                    ▪	Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a 
                    better choice for something like showing a popup once a day.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Geolocation API: </b>Used to obtain geographical position of device. It can be used to find the user's 
                    exact location, link to nearby places, measure the speed at which the user is moving. Due to privacy concerns, 
                    permission to use this has to be granted by the user first.<br><br>

                    <b>Web Workers: </b>Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in 
                    JavaScript (as only one process can run at one time). This enables processes that could take a long time to 
                    be carried out in the background, so a website will continue to function.<br><br>

                    <b>Shared Web Workers: </b>: “Web workers allow computationally complex operations to be performed in a 
                    separate thread, meaning that the flow of a program won't suffer interruptions, and an application will 
                    not freeze or hang. They are a useful feature that help to keep sites responsive, even when complicated 
                    operations are being carried out.”<br><br>

                    <b>Service Workers API: </b>allows worker script to run in the background with the ability to intercept 
                    network requests, also allow access to push notifications and background syncing. This API require a secure 
                    network to run on HTTPS to avoid any malicious code hijacking network requests.<br><br>

                    <b>Websockets: </b>is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server (push messaging). 
                    This means that a connection is kept open and responses are 'pushed' to the client as soon as they are 
                    received.<br><br>

                    <b>Notifications API: </b>allows you to show messages using the system's notifications, usually a popup 
                    in the corner of the screen, depending on the operating system. Before sending notifications, permission 
                    must be granted by the user.<br><br>

                    <b>Drawing with Canvas: </b>canvas element is a rectangular element on the web page that allows graphics 
                    to be drawn onto a web page in real time using JavaScript. It has a coordinate system that starts at (0,0) 
                    in the top-left corner. To add a canvas element to a page, the canvas tag is used specifying a height and 
                    width.<br><br>

                    <h3>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h3>

                    <b>Canvas API: </b>allows us to draw anything we can imagine; shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and 
                    patterns, all through JavaScript. This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to 
                    download images off the network. Canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images and even video.<br><br>

                    <b>Creating a canvas Element:</b>first step to using canvas is to add a canvas element to the page (example 
                    below). All drawing on the canvas happens via the Canvas JavaScript API.<br><br>

                    <b>Accessibility Concerns: </b>A major downside of canvas in its current form is its lack of accessibility. 
                    The canvas doesn't create a DOM node, is not a text-based format, and is thus invisible to tools such as 
                    screen readers. While no solution has been finalized, debates on how canvas could be changed to make it 
                    accessible are underway.<br><br>

                    <b>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): </b>is a file format that allows to describe vector graphics using <b>XML</b>. 
                    Unlike bitmap images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality even as you 
                    blow them up or shrink them down. We can use SVG to do many of the same tasks we can do with canvas, 
                    including drawing paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns.<br><br>

                    <b>XML</b> stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It's a markup metalanguage, like HTML. It's a system meant 
                    to annotate text. Just as we can use HTML tags to wrap our content and give it meaning, so can XML tags be 
                    used to describe data, such as the content of a file.<br><br>

                    Instead of creating SVG images by hand, we can use an image editor to help speed up the process. One open 
                    source tool useful to make SVG images is <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape.</a><br><br>

                    <a href="#">Raphaël</a> is another open-source JavaScript library that makes drawing and animating with SVG 
                    much easier.<br><br>

                    <b>Drag and Drop API: </b>allows us to specify draggable elements, and then specify what should happen when 
                    these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page. With this 
                    functionality, you can drag files from your computer into a web page — or drag elements into other elements 
                    on the same page.<br><br>
